With each tier the chest gets 9 additional slots, so tier three chests are as big as a double chest. 
These chests are also able to be combined into double chests, providing double the storage space. 
Every chest also has its minecart chest variant.

## Storage Barrels

Storage barrels can only store a single type of item. 
You can insert an item by right-clicking the front. 
Double right-clicking inserts all items of that type. 
You can take out a single item by left-clicking and a complete stack by shift + left-clicking. 
A barrel can store up to 3456 items, but this can be changed in the configuration file.
